    "a-b": "You possess the flame of Helm: a sincere and profound one that shines into your darkest corners. Casting its gentle light upon the subconscious realm, the fire illuminates your being in the deepest sense, enabling you to integrate your own shadow towards complete individuation. As an individual who follows one’s inner voice first and foremost, you journey through your life with character and uniqueness. Your goal would be to experience life in its fullest form, understand and connect with your deepest self, and transform yourself inasmuch as your own experience enlightens you. Perhaps, you also believe in determinism or fatalism in a poetic sense: whatever you do, given that you stay true to yourself, the decisions you make and their consequences will eventually lead you to the path that is destined to you. All in all, you are a humble student who strives to embrace the whole spectrum of life in solitude, not succumbing to businesslike mannerisms of half-hearted people. However, it is true that there is also wisdom, although a different kind, behind orderliness and professionalism that you might see as insincere or monotonous; depriving yourself of such rationality might risk your chance of survival in the long run. HEARTH is here to help: with Envisage, increase your capability to strategize by reflecting upon yourself, and eventually accept the wisdom to leading a secure and fulfilling life.",
    "a-c": "You possess the flame of Helm: a sincere and profound one that shines into your darkest corners. Casting its gentle light upon the subconscious realm, the fire illuminates your being in the deepest sense, enabling you to integrate your own shadow towards complete individuation. You are given the power to build your own self; against the endlessly crashing waves of existential fear and angst, you stand firm and dive into the abyss, slowly but steadily revealing one layer at a time. As you see yourself as a blank piece of paper ready to be painted and written down in any direction, you design your life as you see fit, carving and sculpting yourself until you reach the final form: the ideal person that you see in yourself. Although you might realize your own limitations, you strive to be deeper and more integrated, pushing yourself to the limit constantly, dissecting your wills and negotiating with them. In short, you are a shapeshifter, who is at times illogical and even comical, yet brilliant and amusing in the way you think and proceed in your life. Although your tendency to not confine yourself to any box may let you experience something that you would otherwise never have had the chance to, it also creates an unnecessary risk of being presumptuous and out of line, and may trap you in a wishful fantasy. HEARTH is here to help: with Attune, perceive yourself and the world with neutral clarity, mold your existence into an optimal form, and lead an ambitious, yet congruous life.",
    "a-d": "You possess the flame of Helm: a sincere and profound one that shines into your darkest corners. Casting its gentle light upon the subconscious realm, the fire illuminates your being in the deepest sense, enabling you to integrate your own shadow towards complete individuation. Possessing a stern and thoughtful mind, you lead a meaningful life of purpose, experiencing the world in a realistic and sensible way. Without giving into debauchery and immorality, you live a life which you regard as virtuous, keeping yourself in check from excessive fantasizing and hedonism. Furthermore, you have a rather deterministic standpoint regarding life: you would accept and follow the fate which is endowed to you, and despite the worries and doubts from time to time, rather than being discouraged from those hindrances, you would connect to your being in an even more profound manner. In short, you are a modest thinker of solitude who is deeply self-conscious, who leads an effective way of life without being pretentious or wishy-washy. However, as much as your candid simpleness is consistent and reliable when it comes to solving quintessential problems of life, you might be pressed of thinking outside the box; since there are complex and intricate matters which cannot be approached otherwise, it would be wise of you to learn how to view things from a creative angle. HEARTH is here to help: with Reverie, turn on your curious mind, build your original way of thinking, and learn how to apply artistry in everything to lead a more colorful life.",
    "a-e": "You possess the flame of Helm: a sincere and profound one that shines into your darkest corners. Casting its gentle light upon the subconscious realm, the fire illuminates your being in the deepest sense, enabling you to integrate your own shadow towards complete individuation. You are a modest person who leads a quiet and comforting life. Without indulging in narcissistic self-appraisal, you find your confidence in knowing who you truly are; you respect yourself in full scope despite your flaws, or perhaps more so because of them. Your tendency to be calm and collected aligns with humanitarian values, such as peace, good will, and brotherly love; you are likely to be interested in global welfare, if not participate in it. Furthermore, as you are humble and independent, you would be valued as a warm and restful advisor to your close friends and relatives. In short, you are an agreeable person of tranquility, who has a high understanding of oneself, joyfully abiding to your given fate rather than fighting for another. That being said, as your organic way of living lacks in the part of fierceness and passion, you could be underestimating your own potential, taking part in unchallenging roles while you can lead a more fulfilling life in a position of greater meaning. HEARTH is here to help: with Transcend, discover your true passion, grow resilient to failure, and lead a strong and forwarding life.",
    "a-f": "You possess the flame of Helm: a sincere and profound one that shines into your darkest corners. Casting its gentle light upon the subconscious realm, the fire illuminates your being in the deepest sense, enabling you to integrate your own shadow towards complete individuation. As a strong-willed person who holds life with a firm grip, you value being true to yourself more than anything else. Also, it is likely that you find yourself quite different from the norm both in good and bad. You would spend time contemplating alone or enjoying art instead of participating in shallow interactions, which as a result, allows you to understand yourself and connect to your deepest parts, making possible for you to shine as a singular individual. Possessing a certain uniqueness in character, you are a person who people either love or feel distant to; some respect you for your sovereignty, while others deprecate your self-rule. In short, you are a person with a small yet strong social circle, who proceeds with true grit even at the loneliest times, all the while invigoratingly pursuing what you believe to be right. Although you might not feel the need to do so, you must know how to considerately negotiate with others and understand their ways of living, since not only does stepping outside of your circle provide foreign wisdom, but also cooperative force if your temporary objectives coincide. HEARTH is here to help: with Harmonize, unbolt your brotherly empathy, increase your coherence in interpersonal relationships, and lead a life of determination which also resonates with others.",
    "b-a": "You possess the flame of Envisage: an elegant and ethereal one that gleams through the murk. By clearly elucidating equivocal matters, the fire enables you to discern with higher acuity and create a systematic schema, eventually enlightening the pathway to wisdom. As a clever person who understands how to make the most out of any situation by deliberate maneuvers, you make a strong competitor in various fields of interest. Your goals and dreams in life would most likely be in conformity with the societal standards from your culture; whether it be in relationship or career, the ideal for which you strive would be what many others in your stratum also consider to be desirable or even admirable. Since your motivation and end goal is highly relatable to many, it is very likely that you have acquired many friends and colleagues who share your ambition, who all together ensures the validity of your vision. All in all, you are a smart thinker who is skilled in strategizing and implementing the most effective way to achieve a commonly desired objective. Although it is true that your purpose is respected by the populace and thereby offers you a sense of comfort, it does not however, guarantee you a truly valuable journey and result; at times, especially of the modern days of chaotic value structure, it is easy to confuse what is good from what is popular, thus, solitariness and independent thinking is necessary. HEARTH is here to help: with Helm, grow your introspective ability and integrate the part you have neglected, aiming to be a singular, individuated one.",
    "b-c": "You possess the flame of Envisage: an elegant and ethereal one that gleams through the murk. By clearly elucidating equivocal matters, the fire enables you to discern with higher acuity and create a systematic schema, eventually enlightening the pathway to wisdom. As a sanguine thinker who bravely implements, you step forward by following a simple and effective strategy with a sense of austerity. Even at difficult times, you believe in the power of having a good game plan and sticking to it, and perhaps your favorite motto would be something akin to ‘If you can dream it, you can do it.’. Thus, you are likely to value more of the external aspects of a person, such as effort, rather than innate characteristics such as talent. In short, you are a enthusiastic strategist, who believes in a golden formula while not letting the imperfection of the world or yourself hinder with your progress; you endeavour to surpass the limit that is imposed on you with a effective plan and sizable ardor. That being said, your tactic may lack in precision, because the neglect on the part of self-knowledge combined with willful assessment of world would easily cloud and hinder your vision, hence create a plan that does not fit you. HEARTH is here to help: with Attune, improve your cognition by assessing the risks and benefits more precisely, by participating in programs directed to improve the understanding yourself and the world around you.",
    "b-d": "You possess the flame of Envisage: an elegant and ethereal one that gleams through the murk. By clearly elucidating equivocal matters, the fire enables you to discern with higher acuity and create a systematic schema, eventually enlightening the pathway to wisdom. Being a strictly realistic thinker, you are likely to calculate risks and gather as much information beforehand when making decisions, instead of simply going with your gut feeling. And standing by logic even when others tend to be emotional, you seldom yield to unreasonable melancholy or angst. Moreover, you are likely to act adequately and responsibly in social situations and work, rather than acting out your inner urges or speaking out what you really think; after all, this would feel as if you are harming your reputation for no apparent reason. All in all, you are a down-to-earth strategist who stays calm and collected without causing needless commotion and display; you do ‘What you can do’ for the time being, thinking less of ‘What you could’ve done’, or ‘What it could’ve been’. Although your pragmatism is highly useful in most situations, the relative lack in creativity and artistry poses a risk of reaching less than what you are capable of. HEARTH is here to help: with Reverie, embrace your youthful creativity, build an original mindset and reach your ideal state of life.",
    "b-e": "You possess the flame of Envisage: an elegant and ethereal one that gleams through the murk. By clearly elucidating equivocal matters, the fire enables you to discern with higher acuity and create a systematic schema, eventually enlightening the pathway to wisdom. As a person who is careful and punctilious, you are skilled at examining phenomenas, analyzing problems, and revising strategies and plans. You catch onto the details which others might easily overlook, and this astuteness renders your thought processes more accurate and systemic. Perhaps you would have experienced your predictions about the future being more than often correct; this is ascribable to the thoroughness of your estimations, or more precisely, your general personality to be cautious. In short, you are a cerebral person who thinks before talking or acting, and one who can see farther into the future. However, this could also indicate your perfectionistic trait: you might often find yourself not taking the first step at all due to excessive concerns or worrying about possible failures. This may hinder your motivation greatly, which in turn poses a risk of being captured in a placid life where you lose control over yourself. HEARTH is here to help: with Transcend, amplify your drive and passion, build self-efficacy and take full control of your life via self-directed activities.",
    "b-f": "You possess the flame of Envisage: an elegant and ethereal one that gleams through the murk. By clearly elucidating equivocal matters, the fire enables you to discern with higher acuity and create a systematic schema, eventually enlightening the pathway to wisdom. As an independent thinker who penetrates through the naïve, your critical discernment and impartial judgement is well-developed. Moreover, it is plausible that you would act and speak straightforwardly without circumlocution or making excuses for yourself, as you value honesty. Like the fable ‘The Ants and The Grasshopper’, you guide your life with a certain kind of purpose and severeness, while being unsympathetic towards the ones who ‘haven't stored anything away for the winter’. In short, you are a stoic thinker who is hyperconscious; detecting the mischievous acts, or even malevolence, behind superfluousness and fake tears. However, your sense of justice might seem too callous and unforgiving to others, and although you might regard this concern as unnecessary, it may still cost you dearly since social relationships and reputations do matter. HEARTH is here to help: with Harmonize, cultivate your sensibility, learn how to act cogently, and ultimately aim to be a person who can resonate with different kinds of people.", 
    "c-a": "You possess the flame of Attune: a sharp and clever one that luminesces both you and the world with poise. Through elucidating on equivocal matters, it enables you to accurately perceive your given environment and optimize for the best. As you are quick in understanding the apparent needs and wants of people, you adapt to new environments with ease, flexibly rearranging yourself to match the given atmosphere. Societal standards have been well embedded inside your value structure, from your sense of morality to what you consider as successful, and consequently, your beliefs and actions are optimized to function effectively within your culture. Moreover, your overall behavior and the way you conduct yourself would be sensible and witty, since you naturally understand the appropriate responses to everyday situations. By possessing a widely accepted personality, people who are tactful and diplomatic would enjoy acquainting you, which may in turn earn you a reputation of a socialite. Overall, you possess a keen eye which allows you to understand the context of the world like a puzzle piece; thus act in a way that is most appropriate for you even in situations infused with discrete nuances. However, as much as your responsiveness ensures you to be compatible in most circumstances, a lack of resoluteness poses a risk of an existential crisis: a sense of being lost due to not knowing who you truly are. HEARTH is here to help: with Helm, understand your innate and unique wills, deepen the connection with yourself, and set a fulfilling life that is both self-actualizing and pragmatic.",
    "c-b": "You possess the flame of Attune: a sharp and clever one that luminesces both you and the world with poise. Through elucidating on equivocal matters, it enables you to accurately perceive your given environment and optimize for the best. As a lively person infused with optimistic energy, you enjoy life in the present rather than worrying about the future. You immerse yourself in the reality at hand, narrow your focus on the elements that matter, and respond readily. Like a skilled surfer at the ocean, you sense the changing currents and discern the most opportune moment to catch a wave; with each simple and smooth stroke, you make the most out of your given situation. Perhaps, you relate to the following saying: ‘There's no such thing as bad circumstances, only bad assumptions’. In short, you are a person who can aptly utilize what you have in hand; you effortlessly figure out and act on what needs to be done at each moment. However, as much as this Carpe Diem approach allows you to savor simple moments and find contentment in your life, it might provide undue complacency which leads to hedonistic mindlessness, and further deter you from reaching your full potential. HEARTH is here to help: with Envisage, reflect on the past experiences, systemize your thought processes, and finally aim to live a life that is not only cunning, but also wise.",
    "c-d": "You possess the flame of Attune: a sharp and clever one that luminesces both you and the world with poise. Through elucidating on equivocal matters, it enables you to accurately perceive your given environment and optimize for the best. You encounter the world cordially, allowing yourself to embrace and adapt to the world, rather than resist and rebel against it. As you interpret and evaluate results from a pragmatic perspective, you accept situations as they are instead of digging up problems, especially in cases where poking around would not be in your best interest. By the same token, regarding yourself and the world, you do not bother to fantasize ‘What if?’: you would argue that even if there is a critical error, it is better left under the bed if there is nothing to be done with it. This tender practicality of yours is what lets you stay in the light: happy and unbothered, even-tempered and laid-back, understood by most and questioned by a few. In short, you are a person with great pragmatic sensibility, which thereby lets you comprehend the world and yourself in a simple yet effective way, all the while being accepted by the society. Although your utilitarian way of life ensures you stability and a sense of belonging, it would nevertheless be wise to question your ‘common sense’ that you have taken for granted, since many popular beliefs prove themselves to be utterly wrong in the test of time. HEARTH is here to help: via Reverie, nurture your sense of pure curiosity, shape your unique character, and lead a life where you creatively adapt to the ever-changing world.",
    "c-e": "You possess the flame of Attune: a sharp and clever one that luminesces both you and the world with poise. Through elucidating on equivocal matters, it enables you to accurately perceive your given environment and optimize for the best. As a clever person who quickly finds an efficient solution to life’s obstacles, you satisfactorily transform yourself or the situation you are in with ease. Also, you excel at assessing the cost-effectiveness of your options and hence, at an opportune moment, you are able to deliver the most optimal act. On a similar note, it is likely that you are also skilled in reading the room: being aware of the attitude and opinions others possess, understanding their desires, wants and needs. This observance allows you to tone with the request, staying in an apt character regardless of the circumstance. Perhaps, you might at times wonder why some people are ‘trying too hard’, since you plainly see how others could achieve their goals with much less endeavor; although you would believe that it is none of your business to share this reverie. All in all, your greatest strength is your adaptability; without pushing your ideals headstrong, you align your values with that of the world, moving ahead of the game by skipping unnecessary conflicts.
